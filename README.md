# AirBnB_clone Project
An ALX SE clone project of AirBnB Web Application.
Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service that enables people to
lease or rent short-term lodging, including vacation rentals, apartment rentals,
homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The platform allows property owners
(hosts) to list their space and travelers (guests) to book accommodations.
Airbnb operates on a peer-to-peer model, connecting individuals who have
extra space with those seeking a place to stay.
